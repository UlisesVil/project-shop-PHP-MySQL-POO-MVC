# Men's Wear Shop - (PHP, MySQL, POO, MVC Project).

This application is made with PHP and MySQL using the Model View Controller (MVC). This project is running on a host with all its functions and is fully responsive.

The application allows the user to see the products and add items to the cart without having logged in. When the buyer makes an order, the application will ask to log in to continue with the purchase process.

In this application, we can register and log in by saving the user's data in the database with an encrypted password.

In addition, the application distinguishes between an administrator and a customer user of the store.

If the user has logged in as an administrator. We will have more options available in the menu that will allow us to manage categories, products, orders, add or delete products, change the status of Orders between Pending, Preparing, Ready to Ship, and Shipped.

The main menu will add items automatically when the administrator creates a new category.

Product and order data will be store in the database for its administration.

When the user visits the main page, random products appear to give the user a purchase suggestion.

The application keeps track of the available inventory, and if the item is out of stock, it will no longer be displayed.

The Shopping Cart section will keep track of product type, individual items, and the total price.

The detail of the shopping cart will show the list of all the items the user has added. There are buttons to increase or decrease the number of them.

The user can delete a product individually or empty the cart in its entirety. Also has the option to continue shopping to add more products or place the order and finish the purchase process.

When the customer confirms the order, he is asked for his address to send his products and shows the confirmation screen with the detail, assigned order number of his purchased products, and the products in the cart will be zero again.
